          What is the ideal college course you have to get if you want in the
          maritime industry?
        </h3>

        <p>
          Number one is: BS in Marine Transportation is a professional program
          that deals with the study of navigation, cargo handling and stowage,
          controlling of the safe operation and care for people onboard the ship
          at the operational level. The course consists of a three-year academic
          study and a one-year cadetship onboard a vessel.
        </p>
        <p>
          number two is: The Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering is a
          higher education degree program that deals with the study of marine
          propulsion system, its operation and maintenance as well as
          controlling the operation of the ship and care for persons on board at
          the operational level of marine engineering. in marine engineering you
          can also get the courses (Mechanical engineering, electrical
          engineering)

          <h3>My Sea Service</h3>
          <p>
            I have been in three different ship my first ship was MV. Starlite
            Venus a passenger/roro ship sailing to batangas-iloilo-bacolod my
            contract there was 6 months as a Deck Cadet
          </p>
          <p>
            My second ship is MV. Maine Ehime a Bulk carrier with a sailing
            route of "tramping". what is tramping? A vessel which does not
            operate under any regular schedule from one port to another, but
            calls any port where cargo may be obtained. To be distinguished from
            liner ships, operating according to advertised routes, schedules and
            rates. This was my first international vessel and my contract here
            was 10 months.
          </p>
          <p>
            My third and recent ship was MV. Kirribilli a Bulk carrier with a
            sailing route of "Liner". What is a liner? A ship that regularly
            sails on a fixed route following a schedule is known as a liner.
            This is because they have regular ports of call. My contract on this
            vessel is 9 months with a rank of Ordinary Seaman.

          <h3>Seafarers and Mental Health</h3>
          <p>
            The life of a seafarer can be a difficult one. Whether they fish,
            haul cargo, or haul passengers, it is often, by definition, a life
            away from friends and family. While life at sea can be immensely
            rewarding for some, there can be a high cost. Mental health in the
            maritime industry is a growing concern for mariners and their
            families, employers, fellow shipmates, and government organizations
            like the United States Coast Guard. Thankfully there has been an
            increasing trend in efforts to understand the issue and provide
            support to mariners.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my career as a seafarer, I have watched crewmembers deal with
            many difficult moments in life. While stuck at sea, mariners face
            all sorts of hardships, from struggling marriages and problems with
            children to the death of loved ones. Even positive life events can
            be challenging when not home, including the birth of children,
            weddings, birthdays, and family vacations. I have witnessed many
            mariners miss significant life events due to the nature of their
            work. I have missed many of my own. It can be difficult, and these
            experiences can exacerbate mental health issues. Late at night,
            years ago, I saw one of our crew standing by the rail looking out
            into the dark night sea. I went over to talk to him, and he was
            crying. He said he was done. The specifics are unimportant. He was
            thinking about tying a heavy pipe fitting to his leg and jumping
            overboard. We talked. He made it home. I have lost touch with him,
            but last I heard, he was working on land.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mental health in the maritime industry is a significant issue and
            has implications for both individual health and general safety.
            Zooming out, policymakers should consider mental health when working
            on issues that impact maritime workers. Issues including marine fuel
            decarbonization, port infrastructure, navigation technologies, and
            sustainable supply chains can positively and negatively impact
            maritime workers. For example, maybe more automated systems for
            cargo operations are fuel efficient, but will they displace existing
            workers or perhaps reduce the time at port during which a mariner
            can seek medical care? Will the implementation of these technologies
            put further stress on crews that are already stretched thin? It is
            critical to include workers in policy discussions that will alter
            the conditions of their workplace. In some cases, there may be
            substantial positives; in others, there may be significant
            negatives, but to understand these effects, we must ask the workers
            directly.

          <h3>Maritime Injuries</h3>
          <p>
            Working in the maritime industry is often a lucrative and rewarding
            career, but itâ€™s also well-known for its high-risk environment for
            accidents and injuries. Regardless of job role, almost every career
            in the maritime field comes with inherent dangers. Accidents and
            injuries are a part of the dangers of working in the maritime field,
            but in many situations, can be prevented with the proper safety
            precautions and training.
          </p>
          <img src="./assets/SafetyFirst__88603.gif" />
          <h3>Most Common Maritime Accidents:</h3>
          <h3>Falling overboard</h3>
          <p>
            Falling overboard not only entails falling while out to sea, but
            also falling in between vessels while loading cargo or handing
            fishing gear over from the side of a vessel. To make matters worse,
            rescue efforts are often difficult, placing other crew members and
            workers at risk. Drowning, hypothermia, and a myriad of other
            dangers are possible when falling overboard.
          </p>
          <h3>Slip and Falls</h3>
          <p>
            Vessel decks that are slippery, uneven, or cluttered all play into
            slip and fall accidents. If the slip and fall occurs close to an
            unguarded edge on the vessel, injuries can be devastating,
            including, concussions, spinal cord injures, broken bones, and even
            death.
          </p>
          <h3>Enclosed spaces</h3>
          <p>
            Many maritime workers work in small and/or enclosed spaces, such as
            storage rooms, cargo areas, chain lockers, and access routes. Being
            near toxic fumes and areas that lack sufficient oxygen is dangerous,
            placing these workers at a heightened risk for asphyxia and
            poisoning.
